# the-angry-user-experiment
IPython notebook of a behavioural biometrics analysis on key logger data.

## Human Factors & Behavioural Biometrics
This notebook was created to explore the relationship (if any!) between user emotions and/or fatigue level and keyboard and mouse usage.

I use Pandas for data analysis, and the Seaborn package for data visualization. The keyboard and mouse capture data was originally kept in SQLite and I have stuck with that.

Here is the simple experiment layout. The typing of these instructions was actually the data to be captured:

Start keylogger.
> Type up this experimental outline.
> Calm User, just typing something up. A few instructions, a message maybe. Click to enlarge text window.
> A bit of window movement. Dragging text window around the page.
> Bored User: tracks mouse back and forth â€¦
> User reading document with mouse to help.
> User highlights data to read it.
> User loses mouse between screens.
> User with extremem mouse jerk.
> User picking up mouse to move its postion on the screen.
> User angrily smashes key board.
> Jk,uiolhjmASopwe-1jk,zsdjik,lxsfdfgbrfvd78uikj kl;'/tgyh xfdc
> Some more mouse jerk!
> Typing a sfast as I can because I am hurridly trying to get a message out to someone, seriously as fast as I can > and somehow very accurately as well.
> Perhaps a user who clicks a lot when bored or annoyed. Or they just can't wait when pushing a "button".
Turn of keylogger.
